### **1. Stock**

We demonstrate a full pipeline of a stock trading task in [NeurIPS 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07522).

In the directory `./Stock_NeurIPS2018`, the three notebooks: _**Stock_NeurIPS2018_1_Data.ipynb**_, _**Stock_NeurIPS2018_2_Train.ipynb**_, _**Stock_NeurIPS2018_3_Backtest.ipynb**_ show a workflow of applying ML/RL in algorithmic trading.

Once you are familiar with the above three files, feel free to run the notebook _**Stock_NeurIPS2018_SB3.ipynb**_ and _**Stock_NeurIPS2018_ElegantRL.ipynb**_ that follow a similar process to play with different RL libraries.

### **2. Portfolio Allocation**

The notebook _**FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.ipynb**_ shows how to use FinRL do the classic task of portfolio allocation.

_**FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.py**_ is a single python file that contains all the codes.

### **3. China A share**

_**China_A_share_market_tushare.ipynb**_ demonstrates how to trade on China A share market. We connect with the Tushare library to fetch data from China A share market.

### **4. Stock Fundamental**

_**Stock_Fundamental.ipynb**_ shows the process of training a deep reinforcement learning agent with companies’ fundamental indicators.

_**China_A_share_market_tushare.py**_ is a single python file that contains all the codes.

### **5. Forex Trading**
